Comments of 3T warm bore cryostat and [[3T CL]]
	Dear Mahesh, 
	- I have not yet received the drawings for the current lead and its assembly components (despite intimated  before drawing approval), Please discuss those drawings for each components, from magnet to connection power terminal at RT.
	- It should be ensured that vendor will fabricate assembly component of current lead as it is not part of FIM. 
	- It should be ensured that Vendor have arrangement of various consumable items like soldering wire (for CL), Kapton tape, Teflon tape and proper bolts with spring washer as it is not part of FIM
